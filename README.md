**Real Time Coronavirus map with kibana**

Hi there, My name is Sevban, I have created a Real Time coronavirus map with using ELK Stack and Python Beautifulsoup package.

This map shows real-time Corona virus data from all over the world.

Map is updated dynamically every 5 seconds from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries

Since some countries doesn't share their corona cases data, **there is be data deficiencies in certain fields.**

This map can be edited and redesigned to reflect users' specific needs and requirements with additional or customized graphics.

The preparation and implementation of the project took a total of **1.5 month**.

For your questions, suggestions, and curiosities about the project, you can send an email to tumersevban@hotmail.com.
